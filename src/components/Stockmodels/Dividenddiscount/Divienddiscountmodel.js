            <h1>DDM Variations(dividend discount model formula)</h1>
            <p>The DDM has many variations that differ in complexity. 
                While not accurate for most companies, 
                the simplest iteration of the dividend discount model assumes zero growth in the dividend, 
                in which case the value of the stock is the value of the dividend divided by the expected rate of return.
            </p>
            <p>The most common and straightforward calculation of a DDM is known as the Gordon growth model (GGM),
                 which assumes a stable dividend growth rate and was named in the 1960s after American economist Myron J. Gordon.1
                 This model assumes a stable growth in dividends year after year. 
                 To find the price of a dividend-paying stock, the GGM takes into account three variables:
            </p>
            <p>​D=the estimated value of next year’s dividend
               r=the company’s cost of capital equity
               g=the constant growth rate for dividends, in perpetuity
​	        </p>
           <p>Using these variables, the equation for the GGM is:</p>
